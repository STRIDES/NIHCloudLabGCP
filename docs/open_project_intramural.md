# Selecting Your Google Cloud Project – Instructions for NIH Employees and Contractors

To access your Cloud Lab credits, you need to be working in the correct Google Cloud project. Follow the steps in this document to find it. Please contact the NIH Cloud Lab team at CloudLab@nih.gov if you need assistance.

1.	Log in to Google Cloud from a private or incognito browser using your NIH username (e.g., doej@nih.gov) and either your PIV card and PIN or your NIH password and the Microsoft Authenticator app. If you need more detailed instructions, reference the “How to Access Your NIH Cloud Lab Account” email you received from CloudLab@nih.gov.

2.	After logging in, you should land on the console homepage. Click your profile icon in the top right corner (first image below). If the email address listed under the account name is your NIH username (second image below), move to the next step.

*Note: If you see a different email address, you are not in the correct account. You should be able to resolve this issue by signing out and then back in from a private or incognito browser using the instructions you received from CloudLab@nih.gov.*

3.	Once you’ve confirmed that you’re in the right account, find the project selection tool at the top of your screen. If the project listed starts with, “[your IC]-cl-odss-[your NIH username]-” (e.g., nci-cl-odss-doej-1234), you’re in the correct project and can begin using your Cloud Lab credits. If you see a different project name or a prompt to “Select a project,” click the tool to open it.
