# Selecting Your Google Cloud Project – Instructions for NIH-Affiliated Researchers

To access your Cloud Lab credits, you need to be working in the correct Google Cloud project. The personalized link in the onboarding email you received from `CloudLab@nih.gov` should automatically open the right project. If it does not, follow the steps in this document to find it. Please contact the NIH Cloud Lab team at CloudLab@nih.gov if you need assistance.

1.	Log in to Google Cloud using the personalized link and instructions in the “How to Access Your NIH Cloud Lab Account” email you received from `CloudLab@nih.gov`. Be sure to use a private or incognito browser and remember that you cannot log in to your Cloud Lab account from the Google Cloud homepage.

2.	After logging in, you should land on the console homepage. Click your profile icon in the top right corner (first image below). If the account name starts with “Extramural Cloud Lab” (second image below), move to the next step.

*Note: If you see a different account name, you are not in the correct account. You should be able to resolve this issue by signing out and then back in from a private or incognito browser using the personalized link and instructions you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Make sure you are following the instructions exactly as written.*

3.	Once you’ve confirmed that you’re in the right account, find the project selection tool at the top of your screen. If the project listed starts with “nih-extramural-cl-0000” and the last digits match the digits in your account name, you’re in the correct project and can begin using your Cloud Lab credits. You can find your account name by clicking your profile icon in the top right corner. 

If you see a different project name or a prompt to “Select a project,” click the tool to open it.
