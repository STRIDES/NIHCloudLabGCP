# How to open your GCP Project

1. Open a private browsing window (Incognito in Google Chrome).
2. Follow the link from your onboarding email and [authenticate with your research credentials](/docs/account_registration.md).
3. Now you should be at `console.cloud.google.com`. Make sure the Google Profile showing in the top right says `Extramural Cloud Lab XYZ` or just `E`; sometimes your browser will open with your personal Google account instead of your academic credentials.

2. Now select (A) the project name at the top middle of the screen. In the box that pops up, make sure that (B) NIH.gov is selected as your organization.

5. Under that, select (C) `All` rather than `Recent`. Then click your (D) Project which should be `nih-extramural-cl-00000XYZ-1`, and click **Open** in the bottom right.
