# Selecting Your Google Cloud Project – Instructions for NIH-Affiliated Researchers

In order to access your Cloud Lab credits, you need to be working in the correct Google Cloud project. The personalized link in the onboarding email you received from CloudLab@nih.gov should automatically open the right project. If it doesn’t, follow the steps in this document to find it. Please contact the NIH Cloud Lab team at CloudLab@nih.gov if you need assistance.

1. Log in to Google Cloud using the personalized link and instructions in the “How to Access Your NIH Cloud Lab Account” email you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Be sure to use a private or incognito browser, and remember that you cannot log in to your Cloud Lab account from the Google Cloud homepage.

2.	After logging in, you should land on the console homepage. Hover over the profile icon in the top right corner. An account name will appear followed by an email address. If the account name starts with “Extramural Cloud Lab,” you are in the correct account. 

    *Note: If your account name does not start with “Extramural Cloud Lab,” you are not in the correct account. You should be able to     resolve this issue by signing out and then back in from a private or incognito browser using the personalized link and instructions   you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Make sure you are following the instructions exactly as written.*

3.	Once you’ve confirmed that you’re in the right account, find the project selection tool at the top of your screen. If the project listed starts with “nih-cl-odss-[your university/institution email address before the @ sign]-” (e.g., nih-cl-odss-doej-1234), you’re already in the correct project and can begin using your Cloud Lab credits. 

    If you see a different project name or a prompt to “Select a project,” click the tool to open it.

5.	Click into the search bar and enter the portion of your institutional/organizational email address that comes before the @ symbol (e.g., if your email is doej@uni.edu, search for “doej”).

    Select the corresponding project (e.g., nih-cl-odss-doej-a123) and then click “Open” in the bottom right of the window.

    *Note: If more than one project appears in your search results, your email address is similar to another Cloud Lab participant. To determine which project belongs to you, refer back to the “How to Access Your NIH Cloud Lab Account” email that you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Within the email, hover over your personalized Cloud Lab access link and make note of the last four characters of the URL. Return to the Google Cloud console and select the project in the search results that ends with those same characters (e.g, nih-cl-doej-a123, where “a123” are the last four characters of your personalized URL). Click “Open” in the bottom right of the window.*
