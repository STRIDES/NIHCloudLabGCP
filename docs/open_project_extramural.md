# Selecting Your Google Cloud Project – Instructions for NIH-Affiliated Researchers

In order to access your Cloud Lab credits, you need to be working in the correct Google Cloud project. The personalized link in the onboarding email you received from CloudLab@nih.gov should automatically open the right project. If it doesn’t, follow the steps in this document to find it. Please contact the NIH Cloud Lab team at CloudLab@nih.gov if you need assistance.

1. Log in to Google Cloud using the personalized link and instructions in the “How to Access Your NIH Cloud Lab Account” email you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Be sure to use a private or incognito browser, and remember that you cannot log in to your Cloud Lab account from the Google Cloud homepage.

2.	After logging in, you should land on the console homepage. Hover over the profile icon in the top right corner. Your account name and email address will appear. If the account name starts with “Extramural Cloud Lab,” you are in the correct account. **Write down or make a mental note of the seven-digit number at the end of your account name.** You will use this number in the next few steps to find your project.

*Note: If your account name does not start with “Extramural Cloud Lab,” you are not in the correct account. You should be able to resolve this issue by signing out and then back in from a private or incognito browser using the personalized link and instructions you received from CloudLab@nih.gov. Make sure you are following the instructions exactly as written.*

3.	Once you’ve confirmed that you’re in the right account, find the project selection tool at the top of your screen. If the project listed starts with “nih-extramural-cl-0000” and the last digits match the digits in your account name, you’re in the correct project and can begin using your Cloud Lab credits. You can find your account name by clicking your profile icon in the top right corner. 

If you see a different project name or a prompt to “Select a project,” click the tool to open it.

5.	Click into the search bar and enter “nih-extramural-cl-######-#,” replacing the number signs with the last seven digits of your account name, which you noted in Step 2. 

Select the corresponding project and then click “Open” in the bottom right of the window.

6.	6.	Hover over your profile icon and double-check that the last seven digits of your account name match the last seven digits of the name in the project selection tool. If they match, you are all set and ready to use your Cloud Lab credits. Check out our Google Cloud Jumpstart page for ideas on what to do next!

*Note: If the digits don’t match, you are not in the correct project. Hover over your profile icon to double-check the last seven digits of your account name. Then, repeat steps 4 and 5 to open the right project from the project selection tool.*
