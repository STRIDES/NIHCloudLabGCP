### Using the Parabricks AMI in Cloud Lab

To use Parabricks within AWS, Search AWS Marketplace in the top search box. Then go to Discover Products, then search Parabricks. Click NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines, then Continue to Subscribe, then Accept Terms. You will now pay $0.30 per hour to use the software, plus whatever costs of the VM when they are running. It will take a few minutes for the subscription to complete, and then click Continue to Configuration. We recommend you choose the newest software, select your region, then click Continue to Launch, select Launch Through EC2 under Choose Action, and then select your machine type. The p3dn.24xlarge will be the fasterst machine, but look at all the available options and consider the cost of each machine. Now you launch the machine line any other EC2 instance and you will be ready to use pbrun, the Parabricks CLI.
