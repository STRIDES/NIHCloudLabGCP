## NIH CLOUD LAB PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 

Revised: February 2, 2022 

### PROGRAM OVERVIEW 

Cloud Lab is a service maintained by the National Institutes of Health’s Center for Information Technology (CIT) providing NIH and NIH-supported researchers of various cloud skill levels an environment to evaluate cloud products, run proof of concepts (POCs) or “pilots,” gauge price and technical implications, and create a launchpad to accelerate research. Cloud Lab was created in partnership with major cloud providers and partners.  

In order to access Cloud Lab, you must adhere to the requirements, terms, and conditions set forth in this document. 

### ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 

Eligible users for Cloud Lab include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Governmental User: Individuals employed by U.S. government agencies conducting biomedical research consistent with NIH’s mission, to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. 

Non-Governmental User: Individuals serving as a PI or co-PI on an active NIH funding award (e.g., grant, contract, cooperative agreement, OTA), or designated as such on an application for an NIH funding award with the knowledge and permission of the NIH funding recipient or applicant; or individuals serving as PI or Co-PI on an active or proposed project under an NIH CRADA, with the knowledge and permission of the collaborator institution 

Specific requirements for the Eligible User include the following: 

Eligible User will store data of no greater than “moderate” risk level, as defined by NIST Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199 (“FIPS 199”).  

Eligible User will not store data that is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), nor will they store personally identifiable information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI), except by explicit written consent of NIH. 

Eligible User shall not store data in data centers outside of the Continental United States except by explicit written consent of NIH.   

Eligible Users shall adhere to all U.S. federal, state, and local laws and applicable to his/her use of the Cloud Services, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and export control laws. 

### PROGRAM PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS 

The following requirements apply to all Eligible Users (hereafter called “applicants”) applying for receipt of Cloud Lab Creditsi , whether or not they are awarded such Credits:  

Applicant acknowledges that Cloud Lab Credits are not a part of NIH’s grant-making or other formal award processes. Furthermore, receipt of Cloud Lab Credits to a Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI is not the award of or equivalent to the award of a grant, but results only in the recipient becoming a “Active Participant” in Cloud Lab.  

Applicant acknowledges that the processes for conferring Cloud lab Credits is separate and distinct from the NIH grant award process, and NIH reserves the right to modify or adopt this in the future. 

Applicant acknowledges that information about applicant’s utilization of Cloud Lab Credits will be available to NIH, and that this information will be aggregated with other data to assess the feasibility of the Cloud Lab approach.  

Applicant acknowledges that NIH makes the final decisions regarding recipients and amounts of Credits. Applicant accepts these decisions are not reviewable and cannot be challenged or appealed. 

Applicant hereby consents to public disclosure of the contents of any application for Cloud Lab Credits. Specific information, including Applicant’s name and overarching research objectives, may be made publicly available in interim or final project reports. 

Applicant acknowledges that the Cloud Lab is a Federal Data System maintained by the U.S. Government. Misuse of a Federal Data System may subject users to civil and criminal penalties.  

In addition to the conditions included above, the following additional conditions apply to applicants who have received Cloud Lab Credits (hereafter called “Active Participants”): 

Active Participant agrees that the conferred Credit amount constitutes the full amount of resources that can be provided in the pilot for any individual application submission. Additional Credits would require a separate application. 

Active Participant agrees that the conferred Credit amount cannot be charged as a cost to an NIH funded research project and that any such charges are unallowable. . 

Active Participant agrees that all Cloud Lab Credits that are not expended within 6 months of the date of award will expire. Upon expiration of the credits or when credits are fully expended, whichever occurs first, the associated Cloud Lab account will be disabled and the credits will be returned to the NIH. 

Active Participant acknowledges that the Cloud Lab is a shared environment, which places considerable responsibility on the Active Participant for maintaining data and application security related to their own activities.   

Active Participant accepts responsibility for protecting intellectual property (IP) consistent with their home institution’s rules and regulations and with U.S. law.   

Active Participant acknowledges that the list of example responsibilities related to security provided here is not comprehensive, and that there may be civil and criminal penalties for data breaches and/or misuse of the NIH Cloud Lab For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, software programs are employed to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 

Active Participants may be suspended from Cloud Lab, including loss of Credits balance, for violating these terms and conditions, for violating local, state, or federal law, or for any other reason. Written notice will be provided, and NIH may alert the Active Participant’s Organization of any violation of Cloud Lab terms of service. The occurrence of this will result in the suspension of all Credits to the Active Participant in question. This decision cannot be contested. 

Active Participants may opt-out of Cloud Lab for convenience at any time with 15 business days’ notice through submission of an intent letter to NIH CIT. Opting out consists of moving out any data and shutting down any cloud resources associated with their account, resulting in the account being terminated and credits returned to NIH.  Similarly, NIH may terminate Active Participant’s access to Cloud Lab for convenience at any time with 15-business-day written notice.
