    "DNA sequence data are typically deposited into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, and can be accessed through the SRA website, or via command line tools called SRA Toolkit. Individual sequence entries are assigned an Accession ID, which can be used to find and download a particular file. For example, if you go to the [SRA database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) in a browser window, and search for `SRX15695630`, you should see an entry for _C. elegans_. Here we are going to use tools from the SRA Toolkit to download a few fastq files, which can then be copied over to a cloud bucket."

    "Fasterq dump doesn't run in batch mode, so one way to run a command on multiple samples is by using a for loop. There are many options you can explore, but here we are running -O for outdir, -e for the number of threads, -m for memory (4GB), and --location for the location we want to retrieve the file from. Depending on the type of cloud storage, it may be faster to select `NCBI` for the location. You may consider running a few tests with one or two of your accession numbers before downloading a whole batch. The default number of threads = 6, so adjust -e based on your machine size. For large files, you may also benefit from a machine type with more memory and/or threads. You may need to stop this VM, resize it, then restart and come back. Note that there are a bunch of ways to split your fastq files (defined [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/HowTo:-fasterq-dump)) but the default of `split 3` will split into forward, reverse, and unpaired reads."
