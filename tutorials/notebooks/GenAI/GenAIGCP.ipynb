In addition, gut microbiota may produce amyloid peptides or a curly type amyloid fiber that is capable of forming seeding for aggregation of amyloid in the brain. These amyloids may also increase the aggregation of other misfolded proteins such as alpha -synuclein. \n",

    "Summarizing a long document can be challenging and time consuming as you are still required to ensure your model has correctly idetified the main points of the article in a concise and coherent way. This can be especially difficult if the document is complex or technical. While these methods allow you to interact with LLMs and summarize long documents in a flexible way, you may sometimes want to speed up the process by using bootstrapping or pre-built methods. This is where libraries like LangChain come in. You can read more about LangChain support on Vertex AI [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/google_vertex_ai_palm.html)."
