# GCPCloudLab
There are a LOT of resources available to learn more about GCP, which can be overwhelming. NIH Cloud Labâ€™s goal is to make cloud very easy and accessible for you, so that you can stop wasting time on administrative tasks and focus on your research. 

Use this repository to learn about how to use GCP by exploring the linked resources and walking through the tutorials. If you are a beginner, we suggest you begin with the [GCPJumpstart](GCPJumpstart) section. If you already have foundational knowledge of GCP and cloud, feel free to skip ahead to the [tutorials](tutorials) section for in-depth examples of how to run specific workflows such as genomic variant calling and medical image analyis.
