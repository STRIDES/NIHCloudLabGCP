    "## Overview\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build a chatbot that utilizes data from a datastore that contains URLs relating to Snakemake information as its source. Grounding in this context means ensuring that the model's responses are strictly based on the information available on the website. The data store, which contains information from publicly indexed websites using a web crawler, allows you to specify domains and configure search or recommendation features based on the data collected from these sites. Grounding is a component of RAG but in this example, it operates at a higher level by the model assuming the information it already knows is not completely accurate. This ensures that the model fully depends on the data source for its responses. In turn, this helps RAG enhance the quality and accuracy of text generation by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. For additional details on Agent Builder grounding, please refer to the __[GCP_Grounding](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/blob/main/notebooks/GenAI/GCP_Grounding.ipynb)__ tutorial. \n",
